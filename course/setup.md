# Courseware as Code site template

This repository contains a template for **Courseware as Code**, which will allow you to easily generate a static website that can be deployed to Gitlab Pages for free.
Its main objective is to make hosting educational content as easy as possible.

This project started out as a fork of the amazing Jekyll template [just-the-docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/).
Courseware as Code wouldn't be possible without it.

## Hosting your own Courseware as Code

To start hosting this template on [Gitlab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/), you'll need to:

- Create your own repository based on the template.
- Change the necessary configurations.

After these two steps, you'll have access to your own Courseware website!
