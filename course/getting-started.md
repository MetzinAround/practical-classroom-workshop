# Sign up for a GitLab.com account
In order to complete the workshop, you'll need to have a GitLab.com account. If you already have an account on GitLab.com and wish to use your existing account, you do not need to complete this step.

## Validation
Please note, GitLab requires validation using a credit or debit card in order to use certain features, including CI/CD pipelines. We do not charge the card and we do not keep it on file to charge later. It is being used as a way to prevent <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/05/17/prevent-crypto-mining-abuse/" target="_blank">crypto mining abuse</a>.

# Enable GitPod
In the workshop, we'll use GitPod instead of your local machine in order to control differences between operating systems. GitPod is an open-source Kubernetes application for ready-to-code developer environments in your browser. GitPod [integrates directly with GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/gitpod.html). GitPod is a great tool for the classroom because it runs in the browsers and faculty don't have to worry about local operating systems. 

In order to open a GitLab project in GitPod, you need to enable it. 

## Steps 
1. In the top-right corner, select your avatar.
1. Select Preferences.
1. Under Preferences, locate the Integrations section.
1. Select the Enable Gitpod integration checkbox and select Save changes.
