# Overview of GitLab Group and Project Structure

In order to understand the set up process for Courseware as Code, we will provide an overview of how GitLab features are used to organizing your course, store the content, and store the student's work.

The project contains various elements that are useful from a CwaC perspective. We won't use all of them in the figure below, but we are showing them here to help you visualize the possibilities.
